**Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)** is a book that I find  extremely helpful in having a strong understanding of distributed data systems. It was a enjoyable read for someone like me who wants to have more than just a surface level understanding of interacting with APIs, but a deeper dive into how these system works under the hood and their tradeoffs.

This book is a dense read, and something that I notice in particular is that it's hard for me to retain information from this book without some form of notetaking. This github page is thus dedicated for the purpose of summarizing of the most important concept discussed in this book that I find insightful. I hope these notes can also help you out, whether you are just starting out reading and wants to reinforce your understanding, or you just want a refresher.
